# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately.

1. Do **not** open a public issue with exploit details.
2. Contact maintainers through private repository security reporting mechanisms (or designated maintainer contact).
3. Include reproduction steps, impact assessment, and affected versions/commits if known.

## What to expect

Maintainers will aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe.
- Investigate and validate the report.
- Coordinate a fix and responsible disclosure plan.

## Scope notes

Security reports may include:

- Supply-chain concerns in installation scripts
- Unsafe defaults in base image configuration
- Privilege/escalation issues affecting devcontainer usage
- Credential handling mistakes in documented workflows
